## Info

It's a comm. buoy relay network.

Relays connect with each other to form a tree topology network.
They communicate with intents that can carry data and propagate up or downwards on a network.
Relays can be used to separate modules and decouple communication between them.

Check out the [examples](examples/) or read the [docs](docs/).
