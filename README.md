buoy
========

**WIP NOTICE: This code is in active development and the API and concepts are subject to change.**

Buoy helps with app state management.
It let's you create decoupled components
with their own services and events.
These components may also have sub components, which creates a relay network.

Buoy encourages encapsulation of roles and separation of these roles
into self contained components.

## Quick overview
